To configure the spring-boot:run action in NetBeans for a Maven-based Spring Boot project:

1. Open Project Properties:
2. Right-click on your Spring Boot project in the NetBeans "Projects" window.
3. Select "Properties" from the context menu.
4. Navigate to Actions:
5. In the "Project Properties" dialog, select the "Actions" category from the left-hand pane.
6. Configure "Run Project" or "Debug Project" Action:
7. From the "Actions" dropdown, choose either "Run Project" or "Debug Project" depending on your intended action.
8. Set Execute Goals:
9. In the "Execute Goals" field, enter spring-boot:run.

This tells Maven to execute the Spring Boot plugin's run goal when this NetBeans action is triggered.
